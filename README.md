## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to `explain to anyone`, **without the help of Google**:

- What is a binary tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
